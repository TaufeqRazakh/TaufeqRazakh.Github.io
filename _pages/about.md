I am pursuing my doctoral degree in computer science (CS) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) (USC), advised by Prof. [Aiichiro Nakano](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Nakano/Aiichiro). I carry out performance optimization of our nonadiabatic quantum molecular dynamics (NAQMD) simulation engines. I also interned at [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/) (ALCF) under the supervision of Dr. [Ye Luo](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ye-luo).

I received two master degrees for computer science and mechanical engineering from USC. While a master student, I was advised by Prof. [Ken-ichi Nomura](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Nomura/Ken-ichi) and published on a differential equation solver based on physics-informed neural network (PINN) for molecular dynamics. My bachelor degree was in mechanical engineering from Osmania University in 2016.
